# Fast Optimization Visualizer

## Requirements
- **Platform**: Tested on Windows. Other platforms have not been tested.
- The environment can be set up using the `environment.yml` file.
- **PyOpenGL Issue**: Installing PyOpenGL directly with `pip` may not work. If you encounter issues, download and install the appropriate wheel file manually from [here](https://github.com/cgohlke/pyopengl-build/releases/tag/v3.1.8).

## Usage
To run the visualizer, use the following command:
```bash
$ main.py -lg *.lg -opt *.opt -postlg *_post.lg -o output.mp4 [-display] [-max_cell_num NUM]
```
Alternatively, you can run the executable file:
```bash
$ visualizer.exe -lg *.lg -opt *.opt -postlg *_post.lg -o output.mp4 [-display] [-max_cell_num NUM]
```
- `-display`: Enables rendering the frames on the screen. If not set, the rendering process will be faster.
- `-max_cell_num`: Sets the maximum number of cells in the test case. The default is `500000`. Increase this value if your test case contains more cells.


- The visualizer will generate a 60 FPS MP4 video, where each step is displayed for 1 frame (1/60 s).

> [!NOTE]
> - The `.exe` file is packaged with `pyinstaller` using the command:
> ```
> $ pyinstaller --onefile --name visualizer main.py
> ```


## Result
- The results are based on the solution provided by my Legalizer and are intended for reference only:

|      Testcase     |# of Steps|# of Moved Cells|Output time|Runtime|Generate Speed|
|-------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|-------|--------------|
|  testcase1_16900  |    1781  |      1438      |    29s    | 37.99s|   46.88fps   |
|testcase1_ALL0_5000|    3420  |      8420      |    57s    | 72.00s|   47.5fps    |
|   testcase2_100   |    2949  |      654       |    49s    | 67.77s|   43.51fps   |
|testcase1_MBFF_LIB_7000|9632  |      9396      |    160s   |276.22s|   34.87fps   |

Here are two example videos generated by the visualizer:

Since the videos of other test cases are too large to upload to the GitHub README, only the small test cases (`testcase1_16900`, `testcase2`) are shown here. For other test cases, refer to the MP4 files in the folder.
> [!NOTE]
> Since the generated videos can be large, the above demo video has been compressed using `ffmpeg`. To compress your own videos, use the following command:
> ```
> $ ffmpeg -i "{filename}.mp4" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset veryfast -c:a copy "{filename}_compress.mp4
> ```
> - Increasing the CRF value reduces the file size but also lowers video quality.
