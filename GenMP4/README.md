# Requirements
- **Platform**: Tested on Windows. Other platforms have not been tested.
- The environment can be set up using the `environment.yml` file.
- **PyOpenGL Issue**: Installing PyOpenGL directly with `pip` may not work. If you encounter issues, download and install the appropriate wheel file manually from [here](https://github.com/cgohlke/pyopengl-build/releases/tag/v3.1.8).

# Usage
To run the visualizer, use the following command:
```bash
$ main.py -lg *.lg -opt *.opt -postlg *_post.lg -o output.mp4
```
Alternatively, you can run the executable file:
```bash
$ visualizer.exe -lg *.lg -opt *.opt -postlg *_post.lg -o output.mp4
```
- The `.exe` file is packaged with `pyinstaller` using the command:
```
$ pyinstaller --onefile --name visualizer main.py
```
- The visualizer will generate a 60 FPS MP4 video, where each step is displayed for 1 frame (1/60 s).

# Result
- The results are based on the solution provided by my Legalizer and are intended for reference only.

Here is an example video generated by the visualizer:

Since the videos of other test cases are too large to upload to the GitHub README, only the small testcases(`testcase1_16900`, `testcase2`) are shown here. For other test cases, refer to the MP4 files in the folder.
> [!NOTE]
> Since the generated videos can be large, the above demo video has been compressed using `ffmpeg`. To compress your own videos, use the following command:
> ```
> $ ffmpeg -i "{filename}.mp4" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset veryfast -c:a copy "{filename}_compress.mp4
> ```
> - The larger the CRF value, the smaller the bitrate, but also the lower the video quality.
